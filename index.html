	<section class="bkgleft"><h3>education</h3>
		<p class="myLife">I graduated from UC Davis a few years ago with an Economics degree while also minoring in Pyschology and Communications. I really enjoyed my time there and Davis is the reason I had the chance to visit SF, and thus leading me to where I am now.</p>

	<section class="bkgcenter1"><h3>work</h3>
		<p class="myLife">Upon graduation, I've had the chance to work in a few different fields comprosed of various job descriptions. I dipped my toes in Accounting, Operations, and Marketing. Currently, I work in Operations for a startup freight company specialized in shipping wine. However, it was in one of those roles, working for a Productivity App Startup that I realized my interest in the Tech Industry.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>WebDev Experience</h3>
	</div>	
			<p>If I had to classify myself based on my knowledge and experience in web development and programming, my level would be "Neanderthal." I am quite the beginner although I did try some Python in an Intro to Computers course I took in college. Aside from that, I have been researching sources online like Codecademy. However, my interest is only rising and I've already had so much fun with DASH and in creating this webpage that I believe I've already learned a great deal!</p>

		<h2>Future</h2>
		<h3>...only time will tell</h3>
	</div>	
			<p>Since graduating and after entering the work force, I grew to learn a lot more about myself including what I enjoy doing and what I plan and would like to do with my life. In that, I see my future entailing web design, web development, app development, and more. I have a huge interest in software and technology and plan to incorporate that in my career path and believe that General Assembly can be the first major stepping stone.</p>
