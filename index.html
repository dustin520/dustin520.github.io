<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>Born and raised in Southern California. I went to school at the University of California, Davis and studied Economics. Upon graduating I worked for a couple years in Los Angeles only to move to San Francisco in May 2013. Since then, I have been working in Accounting and Operations. On my offtime I enjoy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sports and Outdoor Activities</li>
	<li>Exploring the Bay Area</li>
	<li>Trying out new foods and experiencing different cultures</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experience with Web Development</h3>
<p>Prior to coding in Dash, I have not had any experience with web development. I had the opportunity to dab my toes in some Python for a computer class back in college but that's as far as it goes. However, from completing the tutorials and creating this page, I have already learned a great amount and of the power to create that we have at our fingertips. However, I have and am running into some roadblocks including the following which I am working on</p>
<ul>
	<li>Positioning and Sizing Images</li>
	<li>Coding in Javascript to create a carousel</li>
	<li>Polishing this page to look pretty</li>
</ul>
